## Victoria Briceno

###Computer Scientist

** Hello everyone! My name is Victoria Briceno, and I'm a computer scientist. Initially, I wasn't into coding, but I started dabbling with small projects in Android Studio just for fun. That's when I discovered my passion for coding and all things tech. It is gratifying to solve the challenges that come with development. Plus, this field constantly evolves, and I love that there's always something new to learn.

** Over time, I've honed my coding skills and developed essential abilities like teamwork and communication through various projects. I've also learned how quickly you can pick up new programming languages, which is exciting and empowering.

** I wish the best to anyone pursuing this pathâ€”enjoy the journey as much as I do!
